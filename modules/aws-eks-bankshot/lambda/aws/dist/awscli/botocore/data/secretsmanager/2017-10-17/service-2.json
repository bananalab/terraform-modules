By using information that's collected by Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, you can determine the requests successfully made to Secrets Manager, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. For more about Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager and support for Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/monitoring.html#monitoring_cloudtrail\">Logging Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager Events with Amazon Web Services CloudTrail</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager User Guide</i>.
