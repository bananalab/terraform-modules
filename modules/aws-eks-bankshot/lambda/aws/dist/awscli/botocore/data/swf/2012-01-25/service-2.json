  "documentation": "<fullname>Amazon Simple Workflow Service</fullname> <p>The Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) makes it easy to build applications that use Amazon's cloud to coordinate work across distributed components. In Amazon SWF, a <i>task</i> represents a logical unit of work that is performed by a component of your workflow. Coordinating tasks in a workflow involves managing intertask dependencies, scheduling, and concurrency in accordance with the logical flow of the application.</p> <p>Amazon SWF gives you full control over implementing tasks and coordinating them without worrying about underlying complexities such as tracking their progress and maintaining their state.</p> <p>This documentation serves as reference only. For a broader overview of the Amazon SWF programming model, see the <i> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/\">Amazon SWF Developer Guide</a> </i>.</p>",

An <code>UnhandledDecision</code> fault is returned if a workflow closing decision is specified and a signal or activity event had been added to the history while the decision task was being performed by the decider. Unlike the above situations which are logic issues, this fault is always possible because of race conditions in a distributed system. The right action here is to call <a>RespondDecisionTaskCompleted</a> without any decisions. This would result in another decision task with these new events included in the history. The decider should handle the new events and may decide to close the workflow execution.</p> </note> <p> <b>How to Code a Decision</b> </p> <p>You code a decision by first setting the decision type field to one of the above decision values, and then set the corresponding attributes field shown below:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code> <a>ScheduleActivityTaskDecisionAttributes</a> </code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <a>RequestCancelActivityTaskDecisionAttributes</a> </code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <a>CompleteWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</a> </code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <a>FailWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</a> </code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <a>CancelWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</a> </code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <a>ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</a> </code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <a>RecordMarkerDecisionAttributes</a> </code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <a>StartTimerDecisionAttributes</a> </code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <a>CancelTimerDecisionAttributes</a> </code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <a>SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</a> </code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <a>RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</a> </code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <a>StartChildWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes</a> </code> </p> </li> </ul>",
