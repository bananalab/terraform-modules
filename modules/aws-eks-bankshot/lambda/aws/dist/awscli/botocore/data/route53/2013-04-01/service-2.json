For example, you can use <code>ChangeResourceRecordSets</code> to create a resource record set that routes traffic for test.example.com to a web server that has an IP address of 192.0.2.44.</p> <p> <b>Deleting Resource Record Sets</b> </p> <p>To delete a resource record set, you must specify all the same values that you specified when you created it.</p> <p> <b>Change Batches and Transactional Changes</b> </p> <p>The request body must include a document with a <code>ChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest</code> element. The request body contains a list of change items, known as a change batch. Change batches are considered transactional changes. Route 53 validates the changes in the request and then either makes all or none of the changes in the change batch request. This ensures that DNS routing isn't adversely affected by partial changes to the resource record sets in a hosted zone. </p> <p>For example, suppose a change batch request contains two changes: it deletes the <code>CNAME</code> resource record set for www.example.com and creates an alias resource record set for www.example.com. If validation for both records succeeds, Route 53 deletes the first resource record set and creates the second resource record set in a single operation. If validation for either the <code>DELETE</code> or the <code>CREATE</code> action fails, then the request is canceled, and the original <code>CNAME</code> record continues to exist.</p> <note> <p>If you try to delete the same resource record set more than once in a single change batch, Route 53 returns an <code>InvalidChangeBatch</code> error.</p> </note> <p> <b>Traffic Flow</b> </p> <p>To create resource record sets for complex routing configurations, use either the traffic flow visual editor in the Route 53 console or the API actions for traffic policies and traffic policy instances. Save the configuration as a traffic policy, then associate the traffic policy with one or more domain names (such as example.com) or subdomain names (such as www.example.com), in the same hosted zone or in multiple hosted zones. You can roll back the updates if the new configuration isn't performing as expected. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/traffic-flow.html\">Using Traffic Flow to Route DNS Traffic</a> in the <i>Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Create, Delete, and Upsert</b> </p> <p>Use <code>ChangeResourceRecordsSetsRequest</code> to perform the following actions:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>CREATE</code>: Creates a resource record set that has the specified values.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DELETE</code>: Deletes an existing resource record set that has the specified values.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>UPSERT</code>: If a resource set exists Route 53 updates it with the values in the request. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Syntaxes for Creating, Updating, and Deleting Resource Record Sets</b> </p> <p>The syntax for a request depends on the type of resource record set that you want to create, delete, or update, such as weighted, alias, or failover. The XML elements in your request must appear in the order listed in the syntax. </p> <p>For an example for each type of resource record set, see \"Examples.\"</p> <p>Don't refer to the syntax in the \"Parameter Syntax\" section, which includes all of the elements for every kind of resource record set that you can create, delete, or update by using <code>ChangeResourceRecordSets</code>. </p> <p> <b>Change Propagation to Route 53 DNS Servers</b> </p> <p>When you submit a <code>ChangeResourceRecordSets</code> request, Route 53 propagates your changes to all of the Route 53 authoritative DNS servers. While your changes are propagating, <code>GetChange</code> returns a status of <code>PENDING</code>. When propagation is complete, <code>GetChange</code> returns a status of <code>INSYNC</code>. Changes generally propagate to all Route 53 name servers within 60 seconds.

After you create a query logging configuration, Amazon Route 53 begins to publish log data to an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group.</p> <p>DNS query logs contain information about the queries that Route 53 receives for a specified public hosted zone, such as the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Route 53 edge location that responded to the DNS query</p> </li> <li> <p>Domain or subdomain that was requested</p> </li> <li> <p>DNS record type, such as A or AAAA</p> </li> <li> <p>DNS response code, such as <code>NoError</code> or <code>ServFail</code> </p> </li> </ul> <dl> <dt>Log Group and Resource Policy</dt> <dd> <p>Before you create a query logging configuration, perform the following operations.</p> <note> <p>If you create a query logging configuration using the Route 53 console, Route 53 performs these operations automatically.</p> </note> <ol> <li> <p>Create a CloudWatch Logs log group, and make note of the ARN, which you specify when you create a query logging configuration. Note the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You must create the log group in the us-east-1 region.</p> </li> <li> <p>You must use the same Amazon Web Services account to create the log group and the hosted zone that you want to configure query logging for.</p> </li> <li> <p>When you create log groups for query logging, we recommend that you use a consistent prefix, for example:</p> <p> <code>/aws/route53/<i>hosted zone name</i> </code> </p> <p>In the next step, you'll create a resource policy, which controls access to one or more log groups and the associated Amazon Web Services resources, such as Route 53 hosted zones. There's a limit on the number of resource policies that you can create, so we recommend that you use a consistent prefix so you can use the same resource policy for all the log groups that you create for query logging.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Create a CloudWatch Logs resource policy, and give it the permissions that Route 53 needs to create log streams and to send query logs to log streams. For the value of <code>Resource</code>, specify the ARN for the log group that you created in the previous step. To use the same resource policy for all the CloudWatch Logs log groups that you created for query logging configurations, replace the hosted zone name with <code>*</code>, for example:</p> <p> <code>arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123412341234:log-group:/aws/route53/*</code> </p> <p>To avoid the confused deputy problem, a security issue where an entity without a permission for an action can coerce a more-privileged entity to perform it, you can optionally limit the permissions that a service has to a resource in a resource-based policy by supplying the following values:</p> <ul> <li> <p>For <code>aws:SourceArn</code>, supply the hosted zone ARN used in creating the query logging configuration. For example, <code>aws:SourceArn: arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/hosted zone ID</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>For <code>aws:SourceAccount</code>, supply the account ID for the account that creates the query logging configuration.

You must use the CloudWatch API, one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs, or the CLI.</p> </note> </li> </ol> </dd> <dt>Log Streams and Edge Locations</dt> <dd> <p>When Route 53 finishes creating the configuration for DNS query logging, it does the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Creates a log stream for an edge location the first time that the edge location responds to DNS queries for the specified hosted zone. That log stream is used to log all queries that Route 53 responds to for that edge location.</p> </li> <li> <p>Begins to send query logs to the applicable log stream.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The name of each log stream is in the following format:</p> <p> <code> <i>hosted zone ID</i>/<i>edge location code</i> </code> </p> <p>The edge location code is a three-letter code and an arbitrarily assigned number, for example, DFW3. The three-letter code typically corresponds with the International Air Transport Association airport code for an airport near the edge location. (These abbreviations might change in the future.) For a list of edge locations, see \"The Route 53 Global Network\" on the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/route53/details/\">Route 53 Product Details</a> page.</p> </dd> <dt>Queries That Are Logged</dt> <dd> <p>Query logs contain only the queries that DNS resolvers forward to Route 53. If a DNS resolver has already cached the response to a query (such as the IP address for a load balancer for example.com), the resolver will continue to return the cached response. It doesn't forward another query to Route 53 until the TTL for the corresponding resource record set expires. Depending on how many DNS queries are submitted for a resource record set, and depending on the TTL for that resource record set, query logs might contain information about only one query out of every several thousand queries that are submitted to DNS.

Configuring health checks makes sense only in the following configurations:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Non-alias resource record sets</b>: You're checking the health of a group of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs for all the resource record sets. </p> <p>If the health check status for a resource record set is healthy, Route 53 includes the record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.</p> <p>If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set.</p> <p>If the health check status for all resource record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Alias resource record sets</b>: You specify the following settings:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You set <code>EvaluateTargetHealth</code> to true for an alias resource record set in a group of resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A). </p> </li> <li> <p>You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource record set in the same hosted zone.</p> </li> <li> <p>You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set. </p> </li> </ul> <p>If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set to be healthy and includes the alias record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with.</p> <p>If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the alias resource record set.</p> <note> <p>The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a <i>group</i> of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In that configuration, associate health checks with all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias resource record sets.</p> </note> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Geolocation Routing</b> </p> <p>For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the entire United States, for North America, and a resource record set that has <code>*</code> for <code>CountryCode</code> is <code>*</code>, which applies to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy resource record sets in the following order until it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The United States</p> </li> <li> <p>North America</p> </li> <li> <p>The default resource record set</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name</b> </p> <p>If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each <code>HTTP</code> server that is serving content for <code>www.example.com</code>. For the value of <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code>, specify the domain name of the server (such as <code>us-east-2-www.example.com</code>), not the name of the resource record sets (<code>www.example.com</code>).</p> <important> <p>Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Create a health check that has the same value for <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code> as the name of a resource record set.</p> </li> <li> <p>Associate that health check with the resource record set.</p> </li> </ul> </important>",
