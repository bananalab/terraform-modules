Additionally, you can use Applicability Statement 2 (AS2) to transfer files into and out of Amazon S3. Amazon Web Services helps you seamlessly migrate your file transfer workflows to Transfer Family by integrating with existing authentication systems, and providing DNS routing with Amazon Route 53 so nothing changes for your customers and partners, or their applications. With your data in Amazon S3, you can use it with Amazon Web Services for processing, analytics, machine learning, and archiving. Getting started with Transfer Family is easy since there is no infrastructure to buy and set up.</p>",

In this case, the server automatically responds with one of the endpoint IPs within the PASV response. <code>PassiveIp=0.0.0.0</code> has a more unique application for its usage. For example, if you have a High Availability (HA) Network Load Balancer (NLB) environment, where you have 3 subnets, you can only specify a single IP address using the <code>PassiveIp</code> parameter. This reduces the effectiveness of having High Availability. In this case, you can specify <code>PassiveIp=0.0.0.0</code>. This tells the client to use the same IP address as the Control connection and utilize all AZs for their connections. Note, however, that not all FTP clients support the <code>PassiveIp=0.0.0.0</code> response. FileZilla and WinSCP do support it.
