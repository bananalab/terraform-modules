  "documentation": "<fullname>WAF</fullname> <note> <p>This is the latest version of the <b>WAF</b> API, released in November, 2019. The names of the entities that you use to access this API, like endpoints and namespaces, all have the versioning information added, like \"V2\" or \"v2\", to distinguish from the prior version. We recommend migrating your resources to this version, because it has a number of significant improvements.</p> <p>If you used WAF prior to this release, you can't use this WAFV2 API to access any WAF resources that you created before. You can access your old rules, web ACLs, and other WAF resources only through the WAF Classic APIs. The WAF Classic APIs have retained the prior names, endpoints, and namespaces. </p> <p>For information, including how to migrate your WAF resources to this version, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html\">WAF Developer Guide</a>. </p> </note> <p>WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to Amazon CloudFront, an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an Application Load Balancer, an AppSync GraphQL API, or an Amazon Cognito user pool. WAF also lets you control access to your content. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, the Amazon API Gateway REST API, CloudFront distribution, the Application Load Balancer, the AppSync GraphQL API, or the Amazon Cognito user pool responds to requests either with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You also can configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is blocked.</p> <p>This API guide is for developers who need detailed information about WAF API actions, data types, and errors. For detailed information about WAF features and an overview of how to use WAF, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-waf.html\">WAF Developer Guide</a>.</p> <p>You can make calls using the endpoints listed in <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/waf.html\">WAF endpoints and quotas</a>. </p> <ul> <li> <p>For regional applications, you can use any of the endpoints in the list. A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an AppSync GraphQL API, or an Amazon Cognito user pool. </p> </li> <li> <p>For Amazon CloudFront applications, you must use the API endpoint listed for US East (N. Virginia): us-east-1.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs\">Amazon Web Services SDKs</a>.</p> <p>We currently provide two versions of the WAF API: this API and the prior versions, the classic WAF APIs. This new API provides the same functionality as the older versions, with the following major improvements:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You use one API for both global and regional applications. Where you need to distinguish the scope, you specify a <code>Scope</code> parameter and set it to <code>CLOUDFRONT</code> or <code>REGIONAL</code>. </p> </li> <li> <p>You can define a web ACL or rule group with a single call, and update it with a single call. You define all rule specifications in JSON format, and pass them to your rule group or web ACL calls.</p> </li> <li> <p>The limits WAF places on the use of rules more closely reflects the cost of running each type of rule. Rule groups include capacity settings, so you know the maximum cost of a rule group when you use it.</p> </li> </ul>",

A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an AppSync GraphQL API, or an Amazon Cognito user pool. </p> <p>For Amazon CloudFront, don't use this call. Instead, use your CloudFront distribution configuration. To associate a web ACL, in the CloudFront call <code>UpdateDistribution</code>, set the web ACL ID to the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the web ACL. For information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateDistribution.html\">UpdateDistribution</a>.</p> <p>When you make changes to web ACLs or web ACL components, like rules and rule groups, WAF propagates the changes everywhere that the web ACL and its components are stored and used. Your changes are applied within seconds, but there might be a brief period of inconsistency when the changes have arrived in some places and not in others. So, for example, if you change a rule action setting, the action might be the old action in one area and the new action in another area. Or if you add an IP address to an IP set used in a blocking rule, the new address might briefly be blocked in one area while still allowed in another. This temporary inconsistency can occur when you first associate a web ACL with an Amazon Web Services resource and when you change a web ACL that is already associated with a resource. Generally, any inconsistencies of this type last only a few seconds.</p>",

WAF calculates capacity differently for each rule type, to reflect the relative cost of each rule. Simple rules that cost little to run use fewer WCUs than more complex rules that use more processing power. Rule group capacity is fixed at creation, which helps users plan their web ACL WCU usage when they use a rule group. The WCU limit for web ACLs is 1,500. </p>",

For example, if you provide the same rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and management by WAF. If you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and then use that rule group in multiple places, each use creates a separate instance of the rate-based rule that gets its own tracking and management by WAF. </p> <p>When the rule action triggers, WAF blocks additional requests from the IP address until the request rate falls below the limit.</p> <p>You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts requests that match the nested statement. For example, based on recent requests that you have seen from an attacker, you might create a rate-based rule with a nested AND rule statement that contains the following nested statements:</p> <ul> <li> <p>An IP match statement with an IP set that specified the address 192.0.2.44.</p> </li> <li> <p>A string match statement that searches in the User-Agent header for the string BadBot.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In this rate-based rule, you also define a rate limit. For this example, the rate limit is 1,000. Requests that meet the criteria of both of the nested statements are counted. If the count exceeds 1,000 requests per five minutes, the rule action triggers. Requests that do not meet the criteria of both of the nested statements are not counted towards the rate limit and are not affected by this rule.</p> <p>You cannot nest a <code>RateBasedStatement</code> inside another statement, for example inside a <code>NotStatement</code> or <code>OrStatement</code>.

To make changes to the entity associated with the token, you provide the token to operations like <code>update</code> and <code>delete</code>. WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update fails with a <code>WAFOptimisticLockException</code>. If this happens, perform another <code>get</code>, and use the new token returned by that operation. </p>",
